          Rakau Toa was created by Emerson and Katrina Kopae in 2017 to launch in 2018. Both Emerson and Katrina are from Rotorua originally relocating to Hamilton in 2008 so Emerson could gain his arboriculture qualifications. Emerson has worked for lines companies as a Team Leader in vegetation working closely with Linesman. Katrina is an experienced teacher and together they are raising four sons. Their dream of being business owners to achieve flexibility with raising a young family has come with sacrifice but now coming into fruition. Emerson's expertise in Tree Services is phenomenal and exceptional.
